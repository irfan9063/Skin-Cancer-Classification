            Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. It
            occurs when the skin cells undergo abnormal changes and grow
            uncontrollably. The skin, being the body's largest organ, is
            vulnerable to the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
            from the sun, tanning beds, and other sources. Skin cancer can be
            broadly categorized into three main types: basal cell carcinoma,
            squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. However, there are several
            subtypes and classes of skin cancer, each with its unique
            characteristics and potential risks.

            <h1 class="py-5 text-center">The Seven Classes of Skin Cancer:</h1>
            <p>
              <strong> Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma (AKIEC):</strong>
              Actinic keratoses are precancerous lesions caused by long-term sun
              exposure. They appear as rough, scaly patches on the skin and have
              the potential to progress into invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
              Intraepithelial carcinoma, or Bowen's disease, refers to
              early-stage squamous cell carcinoma confined to the epidermis.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC): </strong>
              BCC is the most common form of skin cancer. It typically arises in
              the basal cells of the epidermis and is slow-growing. BCC usually
              appears as a pearly bump, often with visible blood vessels and a
              central crater-like depression.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Benign Keratosis-Like Lesions (BKL):</strong>
              This category includes various non-cancerous skin growths, such as
              solar lentigines (age spots) and seborrheic keratoses. While these
              lesions are generally benign, they can resemble malignant growths,
              and it's essential to distinguish them from true skin cancer.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Dermatofibroma (DF):</strong>
              Dermatofibromas are benign skin tumors that can sometimes be
              mistaken for skin cancer due to their brownish color and firm
              texture. They are generally harmless and often appear on the legs.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Melanoma (MEL):</strong>
              Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. It originates
              in melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing skin pigment.
              Melanoma often presents as an irregular, dark-colored mole or skin
              lesion. Early detection is crucial, as it can rapidly spread to
              other parts of the body if not treated promptly.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Melanocytic Nevi (NV):</strong>
              These are commonly known as moles. Most moles are benign, but some
              may transform into melanoma. Regular monitoring and dermatological
              assessment of moles are essential to detect any suspicious
              changes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Vascular Lesions:</strong>
              This class includes various benign skin conditions like angiomas,
              angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas, and hemorrhage vascular
              lesions. They are characterized by abnormalities in blood vessels,
              resulting in skin discoloration, bumps, or red, vascular spots.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">How common is skin cancer?</h2>
            <p id="treatment">
              Skin cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in the U.S. In
              fact, about 1 in 5 people develop skin cancer at some point in
              their life.

              Treatment depends on the stage of cancer. Sometimes, a biopsy

              to the surface of your skin. Other common skin cancer treatments,

              In most cases, skin cancer can be prevented. The best way to
              protect yourself is to avoid too much sunlight and sunburns. UV
              rays from the sun damage your skin, and over time, this may lead
              to skin cancer.
            </p>
            <h2>How can I lower my risk?</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Ways to protect yourself from skin cancer include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>
                  Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a skin protection factor
                  (SPF) of 30 or higher. Broad-spectrum sunscreens protect
                  against both UV-B and UV-A rays. Apply the sunscreen 30
                  minutes before you go outside. Wear sunscreen every day, even
                  on cloudy days and during the winter months.</span

                  medications you take make your skin more sensitive to
                  sunlight. Some medications known to make your skin more
                  sensitive to the sun include tetracycline and fluoroquinolone
                  antibiotics, tricyclic antibiotics, the antifungal agent

                  Regularly check all your skin for any changes in size, shape
                  or color of skin growths or the development of new skin spots.
                  Donâ€™t forget to check your scalp, ears, the palms of your
                  hands, soles of your feet, between your toes, your genital
                  area and between your buttocks. Use mirrors and even take
                  pictures to help identify changes in your skin over time. Make
                  an appointment for a full-body skin exam with your
                  dermatologist if you notice any changes in a mole or other

              <p class="px-3 py-1">
                Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide.
                It occurs when the skin cells undergo abnormal changes and grow
                uncontrollably. The skin, being the body's largest organ, is
                vulnerable to the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
                from the sun, tanning beds, and other sources. Skin cancer can
                be broadly categorized into three main types: basal cell
                carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. However, there
                are several subtypes and classes of skin cancer, each with its
                unique characteristics and potential risks.

          The Seven Classes of Skin Cancer:
        </h1>
        <div class="col-10">
          <div class="different">
            <p>
              <strong> Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma (AKIEC):</strong>
              Actinic keratoses are precancerous lesions caused by long-term sun
              exposure. They appear as rough, scaly patches on the skin and have
              the potential to progress into invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
              Intraepithelial carcinoma, or Bowen's disease, refers to
              early-stage squamous cell carcinoma confined to the epidermis.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC): </strong>
              BCC is the most common form of skin cancer. It typically arises in
              the basal cells of the epidermis and is slow-growing. BCC usually
              appears as a pearly bump, often with visible blood vessels and a
              central crater-like depression.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Benign Keratosis-Like Lesions (BKL):</strong>
              This category includes various non-cancerous skin growths, such as
              solar lentigines (age spots) and seborrheic keratoses. While these
              lesions are generally benign, they can resemble malignant growths,
              and it's essential to distinguish them from true skin cancer.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Dermatofibroma (DF):</strong>
              Dermatofibromas are benign skin tumors that can sometimes be
              mistaken for skin cancer due to their brownish color and firm
              texture. They are generally harmless and often appear on the legs.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Melanoma (MEL):</strong>
              Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. It originates
              in melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing skin pigment.
              Melanoma often presents as an irregular, dark-colored mole or skin
              lesion. Early detection is crucial, as it can rapidly spread to
              other parts of the body if not treated promptly.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Melanocytic Nevi (NV):</strong>
              These are commonly known as moles. Most moles are benign, but some
              may transform into melanoma. Regular monitoring and dermatological
              assessment of moles are essential to detect any suspicious
              changes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Vascular Lesions:</strong>
              This class includes various benign skin conditions like angiomas,
              angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas, and hemorrhage vascular
              lesions. They are characterized by abnormalities in blood vessels,
              resulting in skin discoloration, bumps, or red, vascular spots.

              their life.

            <p>
              Treatment depends on the stage of cancer. Sometimes, a biopsy
              alone can remove all the cancer tissue if itâ€™s small and limited
              to the surface of your skin. Other common skin cancer treatments,

              In most cases, skin cancer can be prevented. The best way to
              protect yourself is to avoid too much sunlight and sunburns. UV
              rays from the sun damage your skin, and over time, this may lead
              to skin cancer.
            </p>

              <li>
                <span>
                  Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a skin protection factor
                  (SPF) of 30 or higher. Broad-spectrum sunscreens protect
                  against both UV-B and UV-A rays. Apply the sunscreen 30
                  minutes before you go outside. Wear sunscreen every day, even
                  on cloudy days and during the winter months.</span

                  Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if any of the
                  medications you take make your skin more sensitive to
                  sunlight. Some medications known to make your skin more
                  sensitive to the sun include tetracycline and fluoroquinolone
                  antibiotics, tricyclic antibiotics, the antifungal agent

                  Regularly check all your skin for any changes in size, shape
                  or color of skin growths or the development of new skin spots.
                  Donâ€™t forget to check your scalp, ears, the palms of your
                  hands, soles of your feet, between your toes, your genital
                  area and between your buttocks. Use mirrors and even take
                  pictures to help identify changes in your skin over time. Make
                  an appointment for a full-body skin exam with your
                  dermatologist if you notice any changes in a mole or other
